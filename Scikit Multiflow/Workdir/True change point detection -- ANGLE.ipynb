    "Drift detection algorithm ANGLE is feeding with a stationary data stream with noise followed by gradual changing concept, and any true alarm happened would be recorded and counted to the true positive rate, and any true change point detected would be recorded and computed the PWM rate, as well as detection delay and execution time would be also computed in this experiment."

    "\n",
    "This experiment is conducted with exactly the same sets of changing slopes of parameters $\\mu$ and magnitude of variance $\\sigma$. However, this implement only tests the ANGLE performance other than comparison between online and offline true change point detection. Due to the fact of the minimum delay time at least 300 steps, I used 300 steps as the bound of true change points instead of 100 steps in the paper."
